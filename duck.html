            How does DuckDuckGo make money?
          </h3>

          <div class="money">
            We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other
            search engines, ads are<br />
            based on profiles compiled about you using your personal information
            like search, browsing, and<br />
            purchase history. Since we don’t collect that information, search
            ads on DuckDuckGo are based on<br />
            the search results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. For
            example, if you search for<br />
            cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. <a href="">Learn more.</a>

            Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default,
            their trackers have been found<br />
            on 75% of the top million websites, which means they are tracking
            most everywhere you go on the<br />
            Internet (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just
            the tip of the iceberg. <a href="">Learn more.</a>

            Why use DuckDuckgo instead of Google?
          </h3>
          <div class="money">
            Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part
            because Google tracks your<br />
            searches and hides trackers on millions of websites. By contrast,
            our private search engine doesn’t <br />track your searches and
            our<a href=""> DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app </a>block
            Google’s (and<br />
            many other companies’) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep
            your browsing history more<br />
            private, as it should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using
            DuckDuckGo you also escape the<br />
            manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster
            (after all that tracking code is<br />
            disabled). <a href=""> Learn more.</a>

            How do DuckDuckgo search results compare to Google's?
          </h3>
          <div class="money">
            DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without
            tradeoffs in result quality. We<br />
            have everything you’ve come to expect in an online search
            experience, and a few <a href=""> bonus features</a><br />
            that make searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit
            more fun! And, on top of that,<br />
            because there is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the

            Is DuckDuckGo "unfiltered" search engine?
          </h3>
          <div class="money">
            Unlike some other search engines, we don’t alter search results
            based on someone’s previous<br />
            search history. In fact, since we don’t track our users we don’t
            have access to search histories at all!<br />
            Those other search engines show you results based on a data profile
            about you and your online<br />
            activity (including your search history), and so can be slanted
            towards what they think you will click<br />
            on the most based on this profiling. This effect is commonly known
            as the <a href=""> search filter bubble</a>, but<br />
            using DuckDuckGo can help you escape it.<br /><br />

            This does not mean our search results are generally “unfiltered”
            because, for every search you<br />
            make online, a search engine’s job is to filter millions of possible
            results down to a ranked order<br />
            of just a handful. In other words, a search engine has to use
            algorithms programmed by people to<br />
            determine what shows up first in the list of results, what shows up
            second, and so on. Otherwise, for<br />
            every search you’d just get a completely random set of results,
            which of course wouldn’t be very<br />
            useful.

            Is DuckDuckGo owned by Google?
          </h3>
          <div class="money">
            No, we are not and have never been owned by Google. We have been an
            independent company<br />
            since our founding in 2008 and, unlike some other search engines, we
            don’t rely on Google’s<br />
            results for any of our search results. You may notice that we offer
            a Google Chrome extension and a<br />
            Google Android app, but these are also not in partnership with
            Google and actually aim to protect<br />
            you from Google’s online trackers.

          <div class="money">
            It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called
            “Incognito” mode.<br />
            In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes information on your
            computer and does nothing to stop Google from saving<br />
            your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service
            providers, or governments from being<br />
            able to track you across the Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo
            search is completely anonymous<br />
            and if you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private
